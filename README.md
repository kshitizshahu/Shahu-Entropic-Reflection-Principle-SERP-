# 📜 Shahu Entropic Reflection Principle (SERP)
# Part of the Shahu Loop Theory

"""
The Shahu Entropic Reflection Principle (SERP) resolves a critical question in time-loop cosmology:

If antimatter entropy is used to reverse time and form a new universe (A′), but A′ is still made of matter,
does this violate the symmetry of the loop?

SERP answers: No. Because it's not the *substance* (matter/antimatter) that defines balance —
it's the *direction and role* of entropy.

# 🔹 Key Definitions

def universe(name, substance, entropy_direction, time_direction):
    return {
        "name": name,
        "substance": substance,  # "matter" or "antimatter"
        "entropy": entropy_direction,  # "forward" or "reversed"
        "time": time_direction  # "forward" or "backward"
    }


# 🔁 Universe Setup

universe_A = universe("A", "matter", "forward", "forward")

universe_B = universe("B", "antimatter", "reversed", "backward")

universe_A_prime = universe("A′", "matter", "reversed", "backward")  # Behaves like antimatter in loop

universe_B_prime = universe("B′", "antimatter", "forward", "forward")


# ✅ Loop Path:

loop = [universe_A, universe_B, universe_A_prime, universe_B_prime]


# 🔍 Function to Print Universe Roles

def show_loop(loop):
    for u in loop:
        print(f"Universe {u['name']}: Made of {u['substance']}, Entropy: {u['entropy']}, Time: {u['time']}")


show_loop(loop)


# 🧠 Philosophical Meaning:

"""
Entropy is the memory of the universe — not what it's made of, but how it evolves.

In a looped system, roles are defined by causal direction.
Universe A′ is made of matter, but it is born from antimatter entropy.
It plays the antimatter role by flowing in reverse time with inverse entropy.

Thus, symmetry is maintained across the entire loop.
"""


# 🧪 Mini-Example:

# Imagine a clock that runs backward, but still shows the same hands.

# The material hasn't changed — but its function is reversed.

# That is Universe A′: same substance, opposite purpose.


# 🔐 Final Statement:

"""
The Shahu Loop Theory uses SERP to ensure that even when a traveler causes a new timeline (butterfly effect),
the new universe fits into the causal loop perfectly.

Substance may repeat, but entropy direction restores balance.
